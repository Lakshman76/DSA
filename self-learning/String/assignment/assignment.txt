Question 1 : 
Count how many times lowercase vowels occurred in a String entered by the user.

Question 2 :
Determine if 2 Strings are anagrams of each other.
What are anagrams?
If two strings contain the same characters but in a different order, they can be said to be anagrams. Consider race and care. In this case, race's characters can be formed into a study, or care's characters can be formed into race. Below is a java program to check if two strings are anagrams or not.
