// ðŸ’¡*Question 1

// Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array

// You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two integers, m and n. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with Â m rows and n columns using all the elements from original.

// The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of original should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (inclusive) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

// Return *an* m x n *2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible*.

// Example 1:
// input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
// Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]

// Explanation:** The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.
// The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.
// The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.

// solution - 

class Solution {
    public int[][] construct2DArray(int[] original, int m, int n) {
        if(original.length != m*n){
            return new int[0][0];
        }
        int result[][] = new int [m][n];
        for(int i=0; i<m*n; i++){
            int row = i/n;
            int col = i%n;
            result[row][col] = original[i];
        }
        return result;
    }
